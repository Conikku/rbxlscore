# rbxlscore
A improved and faster rewrite of rbxlscore originally by [bluehorns](https://bluehorns.dev/)

This rewrite focuses on making tables cleaner and makes it so you can make logging look good by providing additional info

A github pages site for this is planned if more is added later on, however, currently the api is pretty simple and a markdown file will do just fine...

Here are the documentation for the module
* [Types](docs/Types.md)
* [API](docs/API.md)
* [Example usage](docs/Examples.md)
